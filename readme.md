# **README**

This version of Phlex is no longer under development, and only critical fixes and changes will be issued.

Development has continued on the /beta branch, but mind you, this is in *active development*.

All code and features in the /beta branch are subject to change, so please refrain from submitting issues 
regarding anything you find there. It's more of a reference or sneak peek, and not a finished product.

## CHROMECAST PLUGIN

Yes! There's now a plugin that works directly inside your Plex Media Server that helps Flex TV
bridge the gap between PMS and your Cast Devices! And it works a LOT better than the old version.  You can find it here:
